Please note - there are comments in some samples, not in others. I am putting this repository together from an incomplete set of rproj assignment files done in 2019. There were many more than seven, the other project files appear to be lost. I cannot remember if these were the final projects that were turned in or an earlier version. Please know that I comment my code well, even if it is not always demonstrated in these files. Thank you.
